# Live Query Builder

![Demo](demo.gif)

## About

The Live Query Builder is a streamlined GUI built in React that offers an alternative approach to building, previewing, and editing a SQL query in real time. The GUI leverages the React Query Builder UI by Syncfusion and supports advanced filters and SQL operators and clauses. Users can dynamically update the query and compose a SQL query from Looker data (extensible to hit Looker’s API). We used the Looker Extension framework to host the project and added a modal component to demonstrate how query results could be displayed on the same page as the SQL query. SQL text formatting and highlighting were achieved using SQL Formatter and Prism, respectively.

Special thanks to the following sites and helpful tutorials:

- [SQL Formatter](https://github.com/mrdziuban/sql-formatter#es6)
- [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)
- [Syncfusion](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/query-builder/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
